    "text": "Hello and welcome to my academic blog!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfrom Unsplash by Alina Grubnyak\n\n\nI’m thrilled to share this space where I can connect with you, whether you’re a fellow researcher, a student, or simply someone curious about the fascinating world of neuroscience and decision-making. This blog marks the beginning of an exciting journey where I hope to demystify complex scientific ideas, share insights from my research, and spark conversations about the ever-evolving fields of cognitive neuroscience and psychology.\n\nA Bit About Me\nI am a cognitive neuroscience researcher with a passion for understanding how the brain and body work together to shape our decisions. My work focuses on interoceptive processing — how the brain perceives signals from the body, like a heartbeat — and its role in moral decision-making. Specifically, I study how these signals influence the choices we make when faced with ethical dilemmas, such as whether to prioritize personal relationships or the greater good.\nUsing advanced neuroimaging tools like EEG (electroencephalography) and ECG (electrocardiography), I investigate the neural mechanisms behind utilitarian and deontological decisions. My findings not only shed light on the inner workings of the human mind but also open doors to exciting interdisciplinary applications, such as using neuroscience to guide the development of ethical AI systems and human-robot interactions.\n\n\nWhy Start This Blog?\nOver the years, I’ve realized that science doesn’t exist in a vacuum — it thrives when it’s shared, discussed, and applied to real-world problems. That’s why I’ve created this blog: to make neuroscience and decision-making research accessible to everyone. Here, I’ll be exploring topics like:\n•   How interoception influences our cognitions. \n•   Insights into the exciting intersection of neuroscience, AI, and other fields.\n•   Behind-the-scenes stories of my research journey.\nI’ll also use this space to share thoughts on new discoveries, reflections on my academic journey, and tips for those navigating their own research paths.\n\n\nWhat’s Coming Next?\nIn my upcoming posts, I’ll dive deeper into the science behind my research. I’ll explain how interoception shapes the way we see the world and make decisions, why understanding it matters for AI ethics, and how this knowledge can inform real-world applications like healthcare or even designing more ethical robots.\nIf you’ve ever wondered how your heartbeat influences your mind, how neuroscience could make AI more human, or what it’s like to work in a lab that studies decision-making, you’re in the right place.\n\n\nJoin the Conversation\nI’d love to hear from you! Whether you have questions about my research, suggestions for future topics, or your own thoughts on the fascinating interplay between the brain, body, and decisions, feel free to reach out. You can connect with me on my X.\nThank you for stopping by, and I hope you’ll join me as we explore the exciting world of neuroscience and decision-making together!"

    "text": "When we think about our senses that shape our experience of the world, the usual candidates come to mind: vision, hearing, taste, touch, and smell. These senses provide us with a constant stream of information about our external environment, helping us navigate and interact with the world around us. But there’s another sense — one that operates quietly in the background, often unnoticed yet deeply influential. This sense is called interoception, and it’s the brain’s way of perceiving signals from within the body.\n\nThe Basics of Interoception\nInteroception is the reason you know your heart is racing before a big presentation or feel your stomach churn with nervousness. It’s the mechanism that lets your brain monitor and interpret bodily signals, like the rhythm of your heartbeat, the fullness of your stomach, or even subtle changes in your breathing. Though we rarely pay conscious attention to it, interoception plays a fundamental role in shaping our emotions, guiding our decisions, and maintaining our overall health.\nAt its core, interoception is the brain’s way of staying in tune with the body. It allows us to sense what’s happening inside and adjust our actions accordingly. Imagine, for instance, the sensation of thirst. Without interoception, you might not recognize that your body needs water. Similarly, the tightness in your chest during a stressful moment is an interoceptive signal that helps you identify and respond to your emotional state.\n\n\nHow Does Interoception Work?\nUnderstanding how interoception works requires diving into the complex interplay between the body and the brain. Specialized sensory receptors throughout the body detect changes in internal states, such as a full stomach or fluctuating blood pressure. These signals travel to the brain, where areas like the insular cortex — often referred to as the hub of interoception — integrate them and help translate these sensations into feelings. This process allows you to interpret a rapid heartbeat as excitement, fear, or perhaps even love, depending on the context.\n\n\nWhy Does Interoception Matter?\n\n1. Emotional Regulation\nInteroception is deeply intertwined with your emotions. For example, an increased heart rate might signal fear or excitement, depending on the context. The ability to accurately interpret these signals can help you regulate emotions more effectively.\n\n\n2. Decision-Making\nInteroception doesn’t just influence how you feel – it shapes how you act. Studies show that people with stronger interoceptive abilities may make more confident decisions, as they are better attuned to their bodily states during uncertainty.\n\n\n3. Health and Well-Being\nPoor interoception has been linked to conditions like anxiety, depression, and eating disorders. Understanding interoception better could lead to improved treatments for these conditions.\n\n\n\nHow Do We Study Interoception?\nThere are a variety of tools to explore interoception, including:\n\nHeartbeat Detection Tasks: Participants are asked to count their heartbeats without feeling their pulse to test how well they sense internal signals.\nEEG and ECG: These tools measure brain and heart activity, helping researchers examine the neural basis of interoception.\nBehavioral Studies: These investigate how interoception influences decision-making, emotional regulation, and even moral judgments.\n\n\n\nInteroception and My Research\nIn my work, I explore how interoception shapes moral decision-making. For example, when people face ethical dilemmas, their heartbeat patterns and brain activity may influence whether they make utilitarian (outcome-focused) or deontological (rule-focused) decisions. By studying these processes, we can gain new insights into how body-brain connections shape our social and ethical behavior.\n\n\nThe Future of Interoception Research\nThe implications of interoception research extend far beyond neuroscience labs. By understanding how the brain processes internal signals, we can develop better treatments for mental health disorders, design wearable devices that enhance interoceptive awareness, and even inform the creation of AI systems capable of making ethical decisions inspired by human physiology.\nInteroception may not receive the same attention as sight or sound, but it is an integral part of our vivid experience. It bridges the gap between our physical and emotional worlds, influencing everything from the choices we make to the way we perceive ourselves. In the coming posts, I’ll delve deeper into how interoception shapes our trust in others, the ethical decisions we face, and the potential it holds for advancing both neuroscience and technology. For now, I invite you to reflect on the quiet dialogue happening within your body — a conversation that’s shaping your life in ways you might not yet realize.\n\n\nWhat to Learn More?\nFeel free to connect with me on X or explore my other posts for more insights into the fascinating world of neuroscience and decision-making.\n\n\nReferences for Further Reading\n\nCraig, A.
