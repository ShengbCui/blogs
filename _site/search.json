    "text": "Hello and welcome to my academic blog!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfrom Unsplash by Alina Grubnyak\n\n\nI’m thrilled to share this space where I can connect with you, whether you’re a fellow researcher, a student, or simply someone curious about the fascinating world of neuroscience and decision-making. This blog marks the beginning of an exciting journey where I hope to demystify complex scientific ideas, share insights from my research, and spark conversations about the ever-evolving fields of cognitive neuroscience and psychology.\n\nA Bit About Me\nI am a cognitive neuroscience researcher with a passion for understanding how the brain and body work together to shape our decisions. My work focuses on interoceptive processing — how the brain perceives signals from the body, like a heartbeat — and its role in moral decision-making. Specifically, I study how these signals influence the choices we make when faced with ethical dilemmas, such as whether to prioritize personal relationships or the greater good.\nUsing advanced neuroimaging tools like EEG (electroencephalography) and ECG (electrocardiography), I investigate the neural mechanisms behind utilitarian and deontological decisions. My findings not only shed light on the inner workings of the human mind but also open doors to exciting interdisciplinary applications, such as using neuroscience to guide the development of ethical AI systems and human-robot interactions.\n\n\nWhy Start This Blog?\nOver the years, I’ve realized that science doesn’t exist in a vacuum — it thrives when it’s shared, discussed, and applied to real-world problems. That’s why I’ve created this blog: to make neuroscience and decision-making research accessible to everyone. Here, I’ll be exploring topics like:\n•   How interoception influences our cognitions. \n•   Insights into the exciting intersection of neuroscience, AI, and other fields.\n•   Behind-the-scenes stories of my research journey.\nI’ll also use this space to share thoughts on new discoveries, reflections on my academic journey, and tips for those navigating their own research paths.\n\n\nWhat’s Coming Next?\nIn my upcoming posts, I’ll dive deeper into the science behind my research. I’ll explain how interoception shapes the way we see the world and make decisions, why understanding it matters for AI ethics, and how this knowledge can inform real-world applications like healthcare or even designing more ethical robots.\nIf you’ve ever wondered how your heartbeat influences your mind, how neuroscience could make AI more human, or what it’s like to work in a lab that studies decision-making, you’re in the right place.\n\n\nJoin the Conversation\nI’d love to hear from you! Whether you have questions about my research, suggestions for future topics, or your own thoughts on the fascinating interplay between the brain, body, and decisions, feel free to reach out. You can connect with me on my X.\nThank you for stopping by, and I hope you’ll join me as we explore the exciting world of neuroscience and decision-making together!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "When we think about our senses, we often think about the five senses: vision, hearing, taste, touch, and smell. However, there is another sense, one that operates quietly in the background, influencing how we feel, think, and make decisions. This sense is called interoception – our ability to perceive internal signals from our body.\n\nThe Basics of Interoception\nAt its basis, interoception is the process by which the brain interprets signals from inside the body. These signals include:\n\nThe beating of the heart;\nThe feeling of your lungs expanding as you breathe;\nThe fullness of your stomach after a meal;\nOr even subtler clues like shifts in body temperature or blood pressure.\n\nInteroception allows you to monitor these signals unconsciously and use them to guide your behavior. For example;\n\nThat fluttering in your stomach might signal nervousness before a speech;\nA dry throat might prompt you to drink water.\n\nThis sense plays a critical role in maintaining homeostasis – the balance your body needs to stay healthy and functional.\n\n\nHow Does Interoception Work?\nInteroception involves a complex network of brain regions and body systems:\n\nSensory Receptors: Located throughout the body, these detect internal signals like stretch (e.g., a full stomach) or chemical changes (e.g., blood oxygen levels).\nThe Brain’s Insular Cortex: Often referred to as the “hub” of interoception, this region integrates signals from the body and helps you interpret them as feelings or urges.\nAutonomic Nervous System: This system responds to interoceptive signals to regulate functions like heart rate and digestion.\n\n\n\nWhy Does Interoception Matter?\n\n1. Emotional Regulation\nInteroception is deeply intertwined with your emotions. For example, an increased heart rate might signal fear or excitement, depending on the context. The ability to accurately interpret these signals can help you regulate emotions more effectively.\n\n\n2. Decision-Making\nInteroception doesn’t just influence how you feel – it shapes how you act. Studies show that people with stronger interoceptive abilities may make more confident decisions, as they are better attuned to their bodily states during uncertainty.\n\n\n3. Health and Well-Being\nPoor interoception has been linked to conditions like anxiety, depression, and eating disorders. Understanding interoception better could lead to improved treatments for these conditions.\n\n\n\nHow Do We Study Interoception?\nThere are a variety of tools to explore interoception, including:\n\nHeartbeat Detection Tasks: Participants are asked to count their heartbeats without feeling their pulse to test how well they sense internal signals.\nEEG and ECG: These tools measure brain and heart activity, helping researchers examine the neural basis of interoception.\nBehavioral Studies: These investigate how interoception influences decision-making, emotional regulation, and even moral judgments.\n\n\n\nInteroception and My Research"
